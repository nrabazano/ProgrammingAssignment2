## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching 
## the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly 
## In this assignment the aim is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  set_inverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  get_inverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, 
       get = get,
       set_inverse = set_inverse,
       get_inverse = get_inverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
##If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
##then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  
  m <- x$get_inverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$set_inverse(m)
  m
}
